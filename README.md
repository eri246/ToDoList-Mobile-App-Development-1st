You can create a to do list that only you can see and alter but ther will also be a collaborative to do list that anyone can add too. Allow users to set reminders that will be accompanied by a push notification.  
Architecture: React Native for the user interface. Use Firebase to keep track of the collaborative lists. For push notifications we should use Firebase cloud messaging for android devices and a firebase library for apple notifications.
